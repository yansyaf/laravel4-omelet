laravel4 Omelet
===============

An initial Laravel 4 project that will help you quickly develop a webapps. It' i's so simple that you can easily expand it with your own module (of course, It's Laravel right?). It only bundle with the only thing you will probably need on every webapps.

It bundle with:

- Bootstrap 3, only use template from [Bootstrap](https://github.com/yansyaf/codeigniter-omelet) site itself
- Authentication module:
  - Confide for basic user management such as: create, login, reset password, etc.
  - Entrust for role and permission management
  - Dynatable for table front-end (finally found library that much much better that dataTable, indeed!)
